## Data Mining Projects
This repository presents data mining projects aimed at providing a hands-on experience with the fundamental stages of implementing data mining techniques. The project focuses on preprocessing, cleaning, transformation, applying data mining algorithms, and evaluation. The implementation is done in Python using popular tools and libraries such as Jupyter Notebook, pandas, and SciKit Learn.

### **Project 1 Overview**
The main goal of this data mining project is to gain insights from a customer database by performing various data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis tasks. The project is divided into several stages, each focusing on a specific aspect of the data mining process. The stages include:

* **Data Preprocessing - Cleaning and Outlier Detection**
* **Plotting Important Characteristics**
* **Customer Personality Analysis**
* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
* **Clustering**

### **Project 2 Overview**
The second data mining project is about extracting information from a dataset of book recommendations. The project covers:
* **Data Preprocessing - Cleaning and Outlier Detection**
* **Building a recommendation system using cosine similarity**
* **Classification using Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM**
* **Evaluation using precision, recall, and F-measure**
* **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) techniques**
